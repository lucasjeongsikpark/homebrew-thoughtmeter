  caveats <<~EOS
    ThoughtMeter is open source and currently distributed without Apple
    notarization (no paid Developer Program membership). On first launch,
    macOS may block the app: right-click ThoughtMeter.app → Open → Open,
    or approve it in System Settings → Privacy & Security.

    ThoughtMeter needs the Input Monitoring permission to count keystrokes.
    You grant it once: releases are signed with a stable certificate, so the
    permission carries over to later versions. If counting ever stops after an
    update, the app says so and links to
    System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring.
